It still needs more work in the following areas:\r\n    - Rewrite the Device Profile assignation, right now profiles can only be assigned by vendor name but it should also be possible to assign them by device type or model (Something like the Device Authentication Profiles: deviceAuth.groovy)\r\n    - Support The Cisco privilege mode (enable mode) authentication\r\n    - Write more documentation on all the possible configurations options\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n- Collects and Processes device data concurrently (GPars)\r\n- Supports any SSH enabled device (v2+ Only)\r\n- Independent Git Repository for each collected device\r\n- Integration with [HP NNMi](http://www8.hp.com/us/en/software-solutions/network-node-manager-i-network-management-software/) for device discovery\r\n- Device Profile schema validator\r\n\r\n## Working Device Profiles\r\n- Cisco:\r\n  - Routers/Switchs/Nexus (Using TACACS+ enable mode account)\r\n- Fortinet\r\n  - FortiGate Firewalls\r\n- JuniperNetworks\r\n  - Juniper\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n- [Java](http://www.java.com) 1.7+\r\n- [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org) (Only if building the project from src)\r\n\r\n## Build/Run from master\r\n- clone repository\r\n- gradle (in project root)\r\n- The built release zip (build/dist/)\r\n\r\n## Installation and Configuration\r\nTake a look at the CVM [Wiki](https://github.com/syepes/cvm/wiki)\r\n\r\n## Contribute\r\nIf you have any idea for an improvement or find a bug do not hesitate in opening an issue.\r\nAnd if you have the time clone this repo and submit a pull request to help improve the CVM project.\r\n\r\n## License\r\nCVM is distributed under Apache 2.0 License.\r\n\r\n## Used open source projects\r\n[Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org) |\r\n[GPars](http://gpars.codehaus.org) |\r\n[Logback](http://logback.qos.ch) |\r\n[JSch](http://www.jcraft.com/jsch) |\r\n[ExpectIt](https://github.com/Alexey1Gavrilov/ExpectIt) |\r\n[jGIT](http://www.eclipse.org/jgit) |\r\n[groovy-wslite](https://github.com/jwagenleitner/groovy-wslite) |\r\n[json-schema-validator](https://github.com/fge/json-schema-validator)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
